# VISMA SOLUTIONS PROGRAMMING TASK

## How I understood the problem

I had to implement a class which is created from a URI. The URI has a custom visma specific scheme. It then results in an action with parameters.

There is no available client for this class. Thus, we are creating a sample cli app.

## What challenges I had with implementation

I had to look up the following things before I could make this work.

1. how to build a CLI in nodejs
1. regular expression
1. UUID validator

## What could I furthur improve my implementation

Using TypeScript would make this solution better. Using a base interface and actions extending the interface.
